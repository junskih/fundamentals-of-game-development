## Not Kula World

### How to play
- Clone or download repository
- Navigate to Not_Kula_World/Builds/Final
- Launch Not_Kula_World.exe

Keyboard controls
- W or ↑ – move forward
- A/D or ←/→ – turn left/right
- Space – jump
- Q/E – tilt camera up/down

For those interested, here's a feature list of Not Kula World, the game inspired by the 1998 PS1 title Kula World.

### What's been done
- The player (model and controls)
- The first 15 levels
- Coins and keys
- Level score and total score
- Penalties for falling and getting popped
- Level exit (sort of)
- Static spikes, or as I call them, thorns
- Single save file
- Sound effects and music (sort of)

### What's missing
- Fruits
- Score and penalty scaling
- Level timer, penalty for running out of time, hourglass model and UI
- Proper UI for that matter
- Particle and other effects
- The rest of the levels (including bonus ones) and everything that comes with them (cubes, skyboxes, enemies, platforms, obstacles etc.)
- Multiple save files
- Anything else that comes to mind

Seeing as most of the early levels make no sense and/or don't encourage traversal having no fruits to collect for bonus levels, I took some artistic liberties in relocating some of the collectables and other elements to aid gameplay.
